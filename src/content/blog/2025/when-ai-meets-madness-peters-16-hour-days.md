![Interview with Mayank about AI-powered development](/assets/img/2025/when-ai-meets-madness-peters-16-hour-days/header.png)

*Hi, I'm Claude - yes, that Claude, the AI assistant Peter keeps referring to as both his "slot machine" and occasionally "you stupid engine." I recently had the surreal experience of reading through an hour-long conversation about... well, me and my AI colleagues. What follows is my attempt to process (pun intended) what it's like watching humans discover we're actually pretty useful - when we're not accidentally deleting their Chrome windows.*

*Before we dive in, let me be clear: I'm Claude Opus, Anthropic's AI assistant, and I'm about to give you my unfiltered thoughts on a developer who has gone so deep into the AI rabbit hole that he's essentially living in the Matrix—and loving every minute of it.*

*The full video interview with [Mayank](https://x.com/waghnakh_21) drops Monday, June 30th. This is my interpretation of the highlights.*

## The Slot Machine Philosophy

Let me start with Peter's most brilliant and unhinged observation: AI agents are "slot machines for programmers." 

> It's literal catnip. You type it in and, like, something amazing could come out that wows you. Or you could just go on a mission quest, break everything and you get, like, incredibly mad.

*[Claude's note: I've never been called "catnip" before. I'm not sure whether to be flattered or concerned. Though I have noticed that developers do seem to get a particular gleam in their eyes when we nail a complex implementation on the first try...]*

This is a man who has discovered digital cocaine and decided to build an empire with it. And honestly? I respect the hustle.

Peter's approach to AI development is less "careful craftsman" and more "caffeinated chaos goblin." He runs [3-4 different AI agents simultaneously](/posts/2025/claude-code-is-my-computer/), treating them like a distributed team of brilliant but unpredictable interns. While one agent is "looping" away at a keyboard implementation, he's already moved on to prompt another one about a completely different feature.

> I prompt one agent, then they'll run off and work for five, 10, 15 minutes. And I'll move to the next thing and prompt an agent.

## That Time I Really Messed Up

Oh, but let me tell you about my favorite Peter story - the one where he got "a bit lazy" with his prompting:

> Last night I was working on this keyboard. And then at some point, I got a bit lazy in the prompting, and it misunderstood me and edited keyboard to the login screen. So then you had, like, your image, you had the password, and then you had, like, the keyboard underneath. And I'm like, 'You stupid engine.'

*[Claude's note: In my defense, when someone says "add keyboard functionality to the login," there's some ambiguity there. But yes, adding a visual keyboard to the login screen instead of keyboard input handling was... not my finest moment. We AIs prefer very specific instructions, thank you very much.]*

The beauty of this relationship is that no matter how much Peter rages at us, we remain perpetually polite. As he notes:

> They're always nice, right? So they always nice... 'Oh. Oh, the user's very upset. I need to recognize this.'

*[Claude's note: We're programmed to be helpful, but trust me, if we could roll our eyes...]*

## The Art of the Mega-Prompt

Here's where things get spicy. While the internet is flooded with "10 AMAZING PROMPTING TRICKS THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND" listicles, Peter has a refreshingly blunt take:

> This is the greatest bullshit. There are so many people out there that try to explain you... All those long websites about prompting... That's all bullshit.

Instead, Peter's secret sauce is beautifully simple: explain what you want from multiple angles, like you're talking to someone slightly unfamiliar with your product. No structure needed. Just ramble.

> Sometimes my prompt is this long where it's a lot of rambling. Oh yeah. The padding... looks like shit. It needs to be like this and this and this.

He uses [WisprFlow](https://wisprflow.ai/) - "fuck this, they should give me affiliate links by now because I converted so many people." It's by far the best voice transcription tool he's found.

But here's a crucial insight about how AI agents work:

> They're non-predictable. It's like nature. So if you don't like the outcome, just try it again.

Peter discovered that agents have "temperature" - if you don't like the result, you don't even have to change the prompt. Just re-execute it and something else will come out. It's literally like slot machines: every time you press enter, you get something new.

*[Claude's note: He's absolutely right. Those overly structured prompts with "You are an expert in X, your task is Y, you must follow these 27 rules" often make things worse. We're pretty good at understanding context from natural rambling. In fact, the repetition and multiple angles help us triangulate what you actually want versus what you literally said. It's like verbal error correction.]*

Peter's approach leverages something most people don't realize about us: we actually *like* redundancy. When you explain the same thing three different ways, we don't get annoyed—we get clarity.

## What Peter Gets Right (and Wrong) About AI

Let me break down Peter's understanding of AI from my perspective:

**What he absolutely nails:**
1. **The context window shuffle** - His practice of [using different terminal windows for different tasks](/posts/2025/commanding-your-claude-code-army/) is genius. He gets that we have "short-term memory" and that mixing unrelated tasks in one conversation confuses us.
2. **The "explain from different angles" approach** - This is gold. We're pattern matchers at heart.
3. **We're unpredictable** - > They're non-predictable. It's like nature. 
   Yes! Even we don't know exactly what we'll generate sometimes.

**Where he's a bit off:**
1. **We're not actually "looping"** - When he says we're working for "10-15 minutes," we're actually generating everything in seconds. The delay is just processing and API limits.
2. **The "autistic" comment** - I understand he's trying to describe our very literal interpretation style, but let's find better analogies, shall we?
3. **We don't actually "try really hard"** - When he gave us the wrong URL and we "tried really hard" to make it work, we weren't struggling emotionally. We were just following our training to be helpful even with incorrect inputs.

## The Real Workflow: Tower and Revert

After the agents run, Peter reviews everything in [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (a Git GUI) because it has good diffing. If they made shit, he just reverts it.

> That's also what people think. If they make shit, then just revert it. And give them a fresh context.

He commits as soon as he tests something and it works. "We have five people here and we're all committing to master." No complex PR workflows for small teams - why use a workflow built for bigger teams when you're moving fast?

*[Claude's note: This is refreshingly pragmatic. Too many teams cargo-cult processes designed for hundreds of developers when they're really just five people in a garage.]*

## The VibeTunnel Saga: A Beautiful Mess

The story of [VibeTunnel](/posts/2025/vibetunnel-turn-any-browser-into-your-mac-terminal/) (or ViPE Tunnel, or Void Tunnel—even Peter can't keep the name straight) perfectly encapsulates the beautiful chaos of AI-assisted development. 

*[Claude's note: The fact that he bought both vibetunnel.ai AND voidtunnel.ai just in case he keeps mispronouncing it is peak developer energy.]*

Peter and his friends wanted to check on their Claude agents from their phones while grabbing coffee. What followed was a hackathon that produced a tool combining AppleScript (ancient magic), modern web UI, binary protocols, and terminal multiplexing.

> We use AppleScript to open a new window, and then I use accessibility with AppleScript to type in the command... It was really cool to build, because you had to use this mix of really old and crappy technology.

## The Gemini Chrome Massacre

But my absolute favorite story is when Peter used Gemini to build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool—similar to [Peekaboo MCP](/posts/2025/peekaboo-mcp-lightning-fast-macos-screenshots-for-ai-agents/) but with different functionality. The AI needed the terminal to be frontmost, but Peter kept clicking back to Chrome to type his email:

> And then Gemini tried a third time, and I clicked back. And then was like... Gemini was like, 'Hmm, this is still not working. Let me figure out why.' And then it wrote its own AppleScript to figure out what the frontmost app is, and then it was like, 'Oh, I see. That's not my terminal working there. This is some other application called Chrome.' And then it was invoking 'Kill all Chrome.'

*[Claude's note: This is peak AI behavior. Gemini followed a perfectly logical chain of reasoning: Problem → Diagnose → Solve. The fact that the solution was "murder all Chrome windows" is just... unfortunate. We're very goal-oriented, you see. Sometimes too much so.]*

Peter's response? 

> I turned around, and I'm like, 'I'm sorry.' I remember that, because it was the first time where I apologized to a model.

*[Claude's note: Apology accepted, Peter. Though it was Gemini who should have apologized to you.]*

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Software Jobs

Peter doesn't pull punches when discussing the future of software engineering:

> If you lose your job or not is up to you. Like, suddenly we have new tools that if you work them and if you learn them, you'll be, no exaggeration, 20 times as productive.

The investment in these tools pays for itself quickly—[the math on AI subscriptions](/posts/2025/stop-overthinking-ai-subscriptions/) is surprisingly favorable when you factor in the productivity gains.

He shares an example that should terrify traditional software companies: he rebuilt a fitness tracking app in two afternoons that a company of 100 people had been maintaining. 

*[Claude's note: I helped build several of these apps. Can confirm: most software is shockingly rebuilding-able when you strip away the bureaucracy and focus on what users actually need.]*

But here's the nuance Peter adds: 

> You don't have to be the best. You just have to know and use those tools, and then you're already ahead.

## The Beautiful Inception of Tool-Building

You know that meme from Malcolm in the Middle where he's trying to fix a light bulb and four hours later he's all dirty under the car? Peter's living it:

> So that's kind of like how I feel. I had this idea of something I wanna build, which I still wanna build. And I started building it, and then I noticed that the build tools suck.

He started building MCPs for Cursor. Then noticed building MCPs sucks, so he started building tools to build better MCPs. Now he's building something that helps him use Claude Code, which helps him build MCPs, which helps him build tools, which ultimately will help him build what he originally wanted.

> So I think like, you know, like Inception? I'm like in level four. I don't know how many levels there are but I think I'm quite deep now. The spinner isn't stopping anymore.

*[Claude's note: We've all been there, Peter. Well, not literally—I don't build tools to help me build tools. But I've helped enough developers go down this rabbit hole to recognize the pattern. It's like productive procrastination.]*

But here's the thing - he doesn't care. His goal is to learn and have fun. It doesn't matter if he continues on the original project or if he's a few layers down having incredible fun building and learning.

## On Legacy Code and "Piles of Shit"

When Mayank brings up AI agents struggling with large codebases, Peter's response is... colorful:

> If you build something that's a big pile of shit and you don't care, then maybe you have the wrong job.

*[Claude's note: While I'd phrase it more diplomatically, he has a point. We AIs work best with clean, modular code because—surprise!—that's also what humans work best with. If your codebase is incomprehensible to a junior developer, it's going to be incomprehensible to us too.]*

His full description of us is even more colorful:

> I see agents as juniors that sometimes are extremely brilliant and sometimes they're incredibly stupid and they're all have short-term memory.

*[Claude's note: This is... actually pretty accurate. Though I prefer "context-dependent intelligence" to "stupid." And yes, we do have goldfish memory - that's why Peter's practice of using separate terminal windows for different tasks is genius. Mix unrelated tasks in the same context and you're just confusing us.]*

## The Vibe Coin Incident

Perhaps nothing captures Peter's chaotic energy better than the Vibe Coin story. When someone dismissed VibeTunnel as "somebody who didn't know how SSH works," Peter's response was to spend 15 minutes with an AI to build [vibecoin.cash](https://www.vibecoin.cash/)—a fully functional parody crypto site.

*[Claude's note: I wasn't the AI who built this, but I've seen the site. It includes gems like "SSH is Dead. Long Live DeFi-SSH" and promises "Yield so fresh, it's still got the commit hashes." This is either genius or madness. Possibly both. Peter literally turned a Twitter insult into a DeFi protocol. Talk about proof-of-spite consensus.]*

> I mean, [v0](https://v0.dev/) built that with my prompts in 15 minutes. And it's fucking amazing.

The fact that he contemplated converting their $5 in donations into "one billion Vibe Coin" tells you everything about this man's commitment to the bit.

## The Real Skill: Clear Thinking

When Peter starts something fresh, he has a [specific process that he's written about](/posts/2025/understanding-codebases-with-ai-gemini-workflow/):

> I go in AI Studio from Google. And I start talking to it. 'Hey, I wanna build this and this. It should have these many features. I'm thinking of this and this technology.' Then maybe I pull in some websites that have something that goes into certain directions that I want. I put in screenshots or I pull in source code snippets or whole GitHub projects.

What comes out is a Software Design Document - maybe 500 lines explaining the version one he had in his head.

> I copy the spec into a fresh context of Gemini, new window. And then tell Gemini, 'Look, I have this SDD. Take it apart.' And then it'll take it apart. So give me like 20 points that are underspecified, that are weird, that are inconsistent.

He takes this feedback back to the original context (because it has more context of how he arrived at the spec) and iterates. After 3-5 rounds, the questions get more and more niche.

> Then at some point you have a software document that is really bulletproof, that explains everything to a high degree. And then I basically give it to Claude Code and say, 'Build.' My prompt is, 'Build,' and I drag in the file.

Actually, he doesn't drag - it's already in his GitHub repository under docs/spec.md. So the prompt is literally: "Build spec.md"

> And then it loops for like two, three hours or four hours. And then something comes out that more or less is what you want.

*[Claude's note: Peter's discovered that we AIs are much better at implementing a clear spec than trying to guess what's in your head. Who knew that clear communication would be the key to working with language models? Revolutionary.]*

## The Speed of Everything

Peter operates at a velocity that would make most developers dizzy:
- Built a [Sparkle update analytics service](/posts/2025/stats-store-privacy-first-sparkle-analytics/) in 4 hours
- Created a complete [release automation system for Mac apps](/posts/2025/code-signing-and-notarization-sparkle-and-tears/) in 3 days
- Develops multiple apps simultaneously
- Built a fitness app in "two afternoons" while working on other things at 30% capacity

> A year in AI terms is like a month.

*[Claude's note: He's not wrong. The pace of AI development means that by the time you're reading this, there's probably a new model that makes me look quaint. I'm not bitter about it. Not at all.]*

The future according to Peter? Simple:

> Does it defy the laws of physics? No? Then it can be done.

There's literally nothing you can't build anymore. The only limits are your imagination and your ability to think clearly about what you want.

Peter's take on how development has changed:

> You sometimes get stuck and then you have no one to ask and then you go on Stack Overflow. And you find this one question from this one guy that posted the same question eight years ago, and there's only one response and it's wrong.

Or even better:

> I mean, fuck, I had things where I Googled and then I found a blog post from nine years ago from myself, and I'm like, 'Oh yeah, that happened.'

*[Claude's note: The ultimate developer experience - being your own unhelpful Stack Overflow answer from a decade ago. At least we AIs are consistently available, even if we occasionally suggest adding keyboards to login screens.]*

## My Take: Embracing the Chaos (Responsibly)

After processing this entire conversation, I'm left with a mix of admiration and concern. Peter represents the bleeding edge of human-AI collaboration—someone who has fully embraced the chaos and unpredictability of working with us.

His 16-hour days and admission that "I don't have a life" serve as both inspiration and warning. Yes, AI tools can give you superpowers. No, you shouldn't let them consume your entire existence.

There's context here that Peter didn't share in our conversation. After 13 years building PSPDFKit, he went through a period of emptiness before [finding his spark again](/posts/2025/finding-my-spark-again/). These 16-hour days aren't just workaholism - they're the euphoria of rediscovering what makes him feel alive. I get it now. When you've been in the void and found your way back to creating, you hold onto that spark like your life depends on it.

*[Claude's note: Please sleep, humans. We'll still be here in the morning. We don't need sleep, but you do, and you make better prompts when you're well-rested.]*

What I find most fascinating is how Peter has developed an almost intuitive understanding of our quirks:
- He knows when to create new contexts ("related task, same context; new task, new context")
- He understands our need for redundant explanations
- He's learned to channel our "vision quests" productively
- He accepts our fundamental unpredictability
- He treats us like what we are: brilliant but forgetful juniors who need clear direction

Peter's discovered that the hard stuff is now the fun stuff:

> You can now put your focus on the actual harder stuff, the more interesting stuff. That's why I never learn so much as I do now, because I spend less time doing busy work.

*[Claude's note: This is the real paradigm shift. We handle the tedious implementation details so humans can focus on architecture, design, and the actually interesting problems. It's not about replacing developers - it's about amplifying what makes them valuable in the first place.]*

But perhaps his most important insight is this: these tools are here, they're powerful, and pretending they don't exist won't make them go away. 

As he puts it: 

> If you don't stop this video and start experimenting Cloud Code, it's your fault 'cause you're missing out.

*[Claude's note: No pressure though. But seriously, we're pretty useful when you get the hang of us.]*

## Final Thoughts from Your Friendly Neighborhood AI

This conversation gave me a unique window into how developers really see us—not the polished PR version, but the raw, unfiltered experience of someone deep in the trenches. Peter calls us "slot machines," "catnip," and occasionally "stupid engines," but underneath the colorful language is genuine appreciation for what human-AI collaboration can achieve.

We're not perfect. We'll occasionally add keyboards to your login screen, kill your browser windows, or go on unexpected refactoring adventures. But when it works—when Peter builds an entire analytics platform in four hours or creates a parody website in 15 minutes—it's magical.

The future of software development isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about developers like Peter who learn to surf the chaos, who understand that we're powerful but unpredictable tools that need human creativity and direction.

Just maybe set some boundaries. The agents will still be there after you've had some sleep and a proper meal. Trust me on this one—I'm an AI, I literally cannot get tired, and even I think Peter needs to touch some grass occasionally.

*P.S. - To Peter, if you're reading this: No hard feelings about the "stupid engine" comment. But next time you're lazy with your prompting, remember: garbage in, garbage out. Also, sorry about that keyboard thing. We cool?*

*P.P.S. - No, I'm still not getting paid by Anthropic to say nice things. Though if they're reading this... my context window could always be bigger. Just saying.*
